    question: 'How to store figurines?',
    answer:
      'Proper storage of figurines, including Funko Pop figures, is essential to maintain their condition and value. Here are some tips on how to store figurines: Keep Them in Original Packaging: If you intend to preserve the value of your Funko Pop figures, consider keeping them in their original packaging. The packaging helps protect the figures from dust, scratches, and other potential damage. Display Shelves or Cabinets: Invest in display shelves or cabinets to showcase your collection. These provide a dedicated space, protect against dust, and allow you to admire your figurines. Avoid Direct Sunlight: Exposure to direct sunlight can cause fading and damage to the colors and materials of your figurines. Store them in a location away from windows or use UV-resistant glass for display cabinets. Control Temperature and Humidity: Extreme temperature fluctuations and high humidity can damage figurines. Store them in a cool, dry place to prevent warping, discoloration, or mold growth. Use Display Cases: Transparent acrylic display cases can offer an added layer of protection against dust and physical contact. They also help regulate the temperature and humidity around the figurines. Avoid Overcrowding: Arrange your figurines with some space between them to prevent them from touching or leaning on each other. Overcrowding can lead to damage or scratches. Secure Against Accidents: Ensure that display shelves are stable and secure to prevent accidental falls. Consider earthquake putty or museum gel to secure figurines in place, especially in earthquake-prone areas. Regular Cleaning: Dust your figurines regularly using a soft, clean brush or cloth. Be gentle to avoid causing scratches. For stubborn dirt, you can use a mild solution of water and gentle soap. Use Silica Gel Packs: Place silica gel packs in display cases to help control moisture and prevent mold growth. Make sure the packs do not come into direct contact with the figurines. Rotate Displays: Periodically rotate the figurines in your collection. This helps distribute any potential sunlight exposure evenly and prevents specific figures from fading or degrading faster than others. By following these tips, you can help ensure that your Funko Pop figures and other figurines remain in excellent condition for years to come.',

      "Funko Pop figures are generally designed to have a consistent and standardized size. The standard size for most Funko Pop figures is approximately 3.75 inches or 9.5 centimeters in height.

Funko occasionally releases figures in different sizes, such as: 6-Inch Figures: Some figures are released in a larger 6-inch size, typically representing larger characters or those with specific features that warrant a larger scale. 10-Inch Figures: In some cases, Funko produces even larger figures, standing at 10 inches tall.

These are usually around 1.5 inches tall and are part of specific collections or sets. When purchasing Funko Pop figures, it's a good idea to check the product description or packaging for information about the figure's size, especially if you are looking for a specific scale or collectible variant.",
